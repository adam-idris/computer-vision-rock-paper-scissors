# Computer Vision RPS

The aim of the project is to create a model that can be used to play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer using the webcam to detect the actions of the user.

# Milestone 1

A repository of the project is created on GitHub.

# Milestone 2

Using a website called Teachable-Machine, a mmodel is created with four different classes@ Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Nothing. Images are uploaded to each class to help train the model to learn and later detect the actions of the user. The Nothing class represents the lack of option in the image. The model is then downloaded and saved to the repository.
