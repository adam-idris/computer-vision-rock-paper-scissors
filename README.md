# Computer Vision RPS

The aim of the project is to create a model that can be used to play a game of rock, paper, scissors with the computer using the webcam to detect the actions of the user.

# Milestone 1

A repository of the project is created on GitHub.

# Milestone 2

Using a website called Teachable-Machine, a model is created with four different classes Rock, Paper, Scissors, and Nothing. Images are uploaded to each class to help train the model to learn and later detect the actions of the user. The Nothing class represents the lack of option in the image. The model is then downloaded and saved to the repository.

# Milestone 3

A virtual environment is created and all dependencies are installed.

# Milestone 4

The function get_computer_choice is created to randomly generate a choice for the computer. It uses the random module to pick an item from the following list:

    ["Rock", "Paper", "Scissors"]

The result is returned and will be compared to what the user chooses.

The function get_user_choice is created to collect an input from the user. The input function is used and the value is assigned to variable, which is returned at the end of the function.

The final function get_winner determines the winner of the rock, paper, scissors game. It uses if and elif statements to simulate all the potential outcomes of the game. It will print the winner at the end.

the play() function ties all these functions together and enables the user to play the game by calling the previous two functions as arguments.
